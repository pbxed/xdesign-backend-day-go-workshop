### - Instructions

You will need to have installed

1. Homebrew
2. Git
3. Go (v1.19.1 is the latest)
4. Text editor (Recommend Vscode)

You should have go installed. If not run the command `brew install go` in your terminal. You will need a code editor. Vscode + the official go extension works well. Run `brew install --cask visual-studio-code` in your terminal to install Vscode. Once installed then open Vscode and go to the extension market place, search for 'Go' and click install extension. Alternatively with Vscode installed click the following link to install the extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go.

You can select which difficulty setting you wish to attempt. Checkout the branch `day_one_easy_mode` where you will find a suggested solution given in pseudocode that you can follow. Alternatively, checkout the branch `day_one_hard_mode` where all you are given is an empty function in which to write your code. 

A completed suggested solution for both parts 1 and 2 is available in the branch `day_one_solution`

Once you have a solution use the following commands in the terminal to run your code

`go run .` This runs your code and outputs a solution to the terminal

`go test .` This runs unit tests to check your answer is correct
